# MVVM-iOS-Templates
 Xcode templates for MVVM module

### Setup

You can use script "install". It creates symlink to "MVVM Templates" folder. And copies it to "~/Library)/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates". With that setup you just need to update repo to get latest templates version.

Alternatively you can simply copy template folder to "~/Library)/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates".
